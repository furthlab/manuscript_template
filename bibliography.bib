	abstract = {Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a highly investigated polymer for the covalent modification of biological macromolecules and surfaces for many pharmaceutical and biotechnical applications. In the modification of biological macromolecules, peptides and proteins are of extreme importance. Reasons for PEGylation (i.e. the covalent attachment of PEG) of peptides and proteins are numerous and include shielding of antigenic and immunogenic epitopes, shielding receptor-mediated uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and preventing recognition and degradation by proteolytic enzymes. PEG conjugation also increases the apparent size of the polypeptide, thus reducing the renal filtration and altering biodistribution. An important aspect of PEGylation is the incorporation of various PEG functional groups that are used to attach the PEG to the peptide or protein. In this paper, we review PEG chemistry and methods of preparation with a particular focus on new (second-generation) PEG derivatives, reversible conjugation and PEG structures.},

	abstract = {Procedures are described for linking monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) to both epsilon and alpha amino groups of lysine. The lysine carboxyl group can then be activated as a succinimidyl ester to obtain a new mPEG derivative (mPEG2-COOSu) with improved properties for biotechnical applications. This branched reagent showed in some cases a lower reactivity toward protein amino groups than the linear mPEG from which it was derived. A comparison of mPEG- and mPEG2-modified enzymes (ribonuclease, catalase, asparaginase, trypsin) was carried out for activity, pH and temperature stability, Km and Kcat values, and protection to proteolytic digestion. Most of the adducts from mPEG and mPEG2 modification presented similar activity and stability toward temperature change and pH change, although in a few cases mPEG2 modification was found to increase temperature stability and to widen the range of pH stability of the adducts. On the other hand, all of the enzymes modified with the branched polymer presented greater stability to proteolytic digestion relative to those modified with the linear mPEG. A further advantage of this branched mPEG lies in the possibility of a precise evaluation of the number of polymer molecules bound to the proteins; upon acid hydrolysis, each molecule of mPEG2 releases a molecule of lysine which can be detected by amino acid analysis. Finally, dimerization of mPEG by coupling to lysine provides a needed route to monofunctional PEGs of high molecular weight.},

This article presents an outlook on the future of bioorthogonal chemistry. I discuss currently emerging opportunities and speculate on how bioorthogonal reactions might be applied in research and translational settings.

A method for this, which could be used in point-of-care devices and high-throughput screening, should be reliable, cost effective and robust. To achieve this, here we design a method (proxHCR) that combines the need for proximal binding with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for signal amplification. When two oligonucleotide hairpins conjugated to antibodies bind in close proximity, they can be activated to reveal an initiator sequence. This starts a chain reaction of hybridization events between a pair of fluorophore-labelled oligonucleotide hairpins, generating a fluorescent product. In conclusion, we show the applicability of the proxHCR method for the detection of protein interactions and posttranslational modifications in microscopy and flow cytometry. As no enzymes are needed, proxHCR may be an inexpensive and robust alternative to proximity ligation assays.},

The carboxyl terminus of Myc family proteins contains a basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif (bHLH-Zip), which has DNA-binding activity and has been predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions. The bHLH-Zip region of c-Myc was used to screen a complementary DNA (cDNA) expression library, and a bHLH-Zip protein, termed Max, was identified. Max specifically associated with c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc proteins, but not with a number of other bHLH, bZip, or bHLH-Zip proteins. The interaction between Max and c-Myc was dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc HLH-Zip domain, but not on the basic region or other sequences outside the domain. Furthermore, the Myc-Max complex bound to DNA in a sequence-specific manner under conditions where neither Max nor Myc exhibited appreciable binding. The DNA-binding activity of the complex was dependent on both the dimerization domain and the basic region of c-Myc. These results suggest that Myc family proteins undergo a restricted set of interactions in the cell and may belong to the more general class of eukaryotic DNA-binding transcription factors.},
