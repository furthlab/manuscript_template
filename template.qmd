  Detecting protein-protein interactions within cells is challenging. Transgenic approaches risk altering protein function via fluorescent tagging, while _in situ_ methods lack _in vivo_ compatibility. Here we introduce fluorogenic probes with dual-tetrazine pegylated branched arms linked to xanthene dye. Activation requires both tetrazine arms to interact simultaneously with target proteins, enabling dual-substrate recognition. We applied this method using antibodies to detect the c-Myc/Max oncogenic transcription factor complex.

Several techniques are available for detecting protein-protein interactions and pinpointing their cellular locations. These approaches can be broadly categorized into two main groups: transgenic fusion-protein techniques, including methods that involve fluorescent proteins [@pfleger_illuminating_2006; @hu_simultaneous_2003], and methods employing a combination of affinity reagents with fluorescence resonance energy transfer or readout by enzymatic detection and amplification techniques using oligonucleotides [@soderberg_direct_2006; @koos_proximity-dependent_2015; @yan_analysis_2003]. 

Transgenic techniques offer the distinct advantage of enabling live imaging, allowing for real-time monitoring of interactions within living cells [@luker_noninvasive_2002]. In contrast, the latter category of methods, utilizing affinity reagents and enzymatic amplification techniques, excels in detecting endogenous proteins where transgenic approaches are impractical, such as in clinical samples.

What has been lacking is a fluorescent technique that operates independently of transgenic expression of fusion proteins, thus sidestepping potential disruptions in protein function due to tagging, while also addressing sensitivity and reliability challenges typically associated with multi-step enzymatic detection and amplification procedures. A unified detection method capable of functioning effectively in both fixed and living cells would bridge these two prominent methodological categories. The integration of non-enzymatic and bio-orthogonal ligation chemistries with fluorogenic properties presents a promising solution to fulfill this critical need [@devaraj_bioorthogonal_2010].


Here we present a method that involves the synthesis of fluorogenic probes, linking a xanthene derivative dye to a branched dual-substrate recognition arm through poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linkers. The fluorescence of these probes only activates upon the simultaneous recognition of both arms by their respective targets. Branched PEG linker arms have long enabled researchers to synthesize compounds with multiple terminal functional groups generating superior properties in cellular uptake and biodistribution [@monfardini_branched_1995; @roberts_chemistry_2002]. These arms are structured to position two reactive groups at a precise distance from each other (**Fig. S1a**), facilitating catalysis of the second reactive group when brought into close proximity by the reaction of the first. We utilized branched PEGylation of a fluorophore to bring into close proximity two tetrazines (**Figure 1a**). Tetrazines in these fluorogenic probes play a dual role. Firstly, they serve as diene groups, engaging in an inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction with their target substrate containing a dienophile [@blackman_tetrazine_2008]. Secondly, tetrazines also function as fluorescence quenchers for the fluorophore (**Fig. 1b**).

Our system boasts a distinctive feature: its inherent bio-orthogonality, achieved through the seamless integration of xanthene derivative dyes, PEG-linkers, and tetrazines. Notably, Janelia Fluor dyes [@grimm_general_2015], a broad subclass of xanthene derivative dyes compatible with our system, demonstrate outstanding photostability and cell permeability, rendering them highly suitable for use in living cells. Furthermore, PEG-linkers, in addition to augmenting cellular uptake, offer stability and in vivo compatibility. Lastly, tetrazines play a pivotal role in bio-orthogonal inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (iEDDA) “click reactions” [@blackman_tetrazine_2008], ensuring the overall compatibility of the system in living and fixed cells.

Prior studies have established that quenching efficiency of tetrazine dyes is significantly affected by the distance between the tetrazine and fluorophore chromophores [@wieczorek_rigid_2014]. 
Consequently, our initial investigation aimed to assess whether the PEG-linker of our probes introduced an excessive distance between these chromophores, potentially compromising 
fluorescent turn-on for practical applications. We evaluated quenching of both a green-fluorescent dye (AZDye488, 494/517 nm) as well as a red-fluorescent dye (AZDye594, 590/617 nm). Despite the increased distance introduced by the PEG-arm, both dyes consistently demonstrate potent quenching capabilities (**Fig 1b**), yielding fluorescent quench emission ratios of `r 5.74` and `r 2.88`, respectively (**Fig 1c**). This highlights the system's capability to effectively quench different fluorophores with varying emission spectra, demonstrating the utility of multispectral detection with the system. Importantly, while the addition of the tetrazine-PEG-arm shifted the excitation peak by X nm in both dyes (**Fig. S1b**), the emission peak remained at X and Y respectively (**Fig. 1c**).

Next, we decided to evaluate the performance of the system by detecting protein-protein interactions directly in fixed cells. We decided to target the the oncogene transcription factor complex cMyc/Max because of its previous utility in evaluating and introducing enzymatic proximity ligation assay to a wider audience [@soderberg_direct_2006]. Furthermore, the complex's unambiguous subcellular localization, primarily within the nucleus, as opposed to each individual protein, which is localized in both the nucleus and cytosol, makes it an ideal candidate for assessing the specificity of our method. Primary antibodies for cMyc and Max were targeted by secondary antibodies conjugated to the dienophile trans-cyclooctene (TCO). After washing, a quick incubation with the pegylated Y-shaped fluorogenic tetrazine probe generated a fluorescent signal restricted to the nucleus (**Fig. 1d**). Importantly, neither cMyc or Max alone (**Fig. 1e-f**) generated a sufficient fluorescent signal, only a slightly higher fluorescence than negative control where primary antibodies were omitted altogether (**Fig. 1g-h**).

Physical proximity alone doesn't always indicate meaningful interaction. To assess the precision of our assay in distinguishing real interactions from randomly co-localized signals nearby, we decided to replace the antibody targeting myc-associated factor X (Max) with a polyclonal isotype control (IgG rabbit). If our method effectively detects genuine protein-protein interactions, we would expect that cMyc and IgG rabbit antibodies should not yield a substantial signal indicating real interaction. This is because the predominant source of the signal is likely to be interactions with Fc receptors and non-specific binding. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- read.table('./data/IgG.csv', header=TRUE, sep=',')
data$zscore <- scale(data$Mean)*10+50

cMycMax <- data$zscore[(!data$cytosol)&(data$groups == 'cMyc:Max')]

cMycIgG <- data$zscore[(!data$cytosol)&(data$groups == 'cMyc:isotype')]

mod1 <- t.test(cMycMax, cMycIgG)

isotype <- data$zscore[(!data$cytosol)&(data$groups == 'isotype')]

mod2 <- t.test(cMycIgG, isotype)

``` 

We  quantified the fluorescent intensity in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol and the samples where cMyc as well as Max primary antibodies were present (_M_ = `r round(mean(cMycMax),2)`, _SD_ = `r round(sd(cMycMax),2) `) had twice the fluorescent intensity (_t_ = `r round(mod1$statistic, 2)`, P < `r round(mod1$p.value, 6)`) compared to samples that either contained cMyc and isotype control (**Fig. 2b**, _M_ = `r round(mean(cMycIgG),2)`, _SD_ =  `r round(sd(cMycIgG),2)`) or isotype control alone (**Fig. 2c**). Importantly, isotype control alone (_M_ = `r round(mean(isotype),2)`, _SD_ = `r round(mean(isotype),2)`) did not differ significantly from cMyc together with isotype control (_t_ = `r round(mod2$statistic, 2)`, P = `r round(mod2$p.value, 2)`), indicating that the short PEGylated spacer arm provides a necessary maximum distance to be able to distinguish true protein interactions from random interactions by proximity.

$7.5 \times 10^3$ PC3 cells were seeded on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (81218, Ibidi). Once the cells reached a confluence of 70%, the growth medium was replaced with 1X PBS (AM9625, Thermofischer scientific) and washed three times in ice cold PBS. The cells were then fixed with PFA (4% v/v Formaldehyde; 28908, Thermofischer Scientific) in 1X PBS for 15 minutes. After fixation cells were washed three times in PBST Triton-X100 ( 0.25% v/v Triton-X100; T8787, Sigma-Aldrich GmBh in 1X PBS) and permeabilized at room temperature for 10 minutes. To remove all traces of  detergent cells were washed three times in 1X PBS. 

Blocking was performed with a goat serum blocking medium (1 % v/v Goat serum; GOA-1A, Capricorn Scientific GmbH, diluted in 1X PBS with 0.1% v/v Tween-20; P9416, Sigma-Aldrich GmBh) for an hour at room temperature. Following this, the blocking medium was washed three times with PBST Tween-20 (0.1% v/v, P9416, Sigma-Aldrich GmBh , in 1X PBS; AM9625, Thermofischer Scientific ) with five minutes of incubation per wash step. The primary antibodies (C-myc Recombinant Rabbit Monoclonal antibody; 27H46L35, Thermo fischer Scientific,  Rabbit polyclonal Anti-Max antibody; HPA003474 , Atlas Antibodies AB) were then diluted 1:500 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA (Bovine Serum Serum Albumin; A9647, Sigma-Aldrich Co in 1X PBS; AM9625, Thermofischer Scientific and 0.1% v/v Tween-20;P9416, Sigma-Aldrich GmBh) and incubated overnight at 4°C on a plate shaker with 300 RPM.

The following day, the cells were washed three times with PBST Tween-20 with five minutes of incubation at room temperature each. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 Chicken Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L); A21441, Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 1:1000 dilution were incubated in PBST Tween with 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Secondary antibodies were incubated in room temperature for 1 hour. The cells were once again washed in PBST Tween with the same protocol as above, then thoroughly washed in 1X PBS.

## Fluorogenic Dual-Substrate Recognition Assay   {.unnumbered}

The experimental procedure closely paralleled the methods employed for immunohistochemistry, with a key distinction being the utilization of a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (31210, ThermoFisher) conjugated to TCO-PEG4 (1398-2, Click Chemistry Tools Inc.) during the secondary incubation step. After washing, cells were exposed to N-(PEG1-AZdye594)-N-bis(PEG2-Tetrazine) at a concentration of 200 nM in PBST for 20 minutes at room temperature. After this incubation, cells underwent another round of washing and were subsequently counter-stained with phalloidin-FITC and DAPI.

## Image acquisition and processing.  {.unnumbered}

Cells were imaged on a Nikon TE2 equipped with a CrestOptics XLight V3 spinning disc confocal. A fluorescent light source was provided by Lumencor’s CELESTA quattro Light Engines with an arrays of 5 individually addressable solid-state lasers.
